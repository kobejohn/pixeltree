pixeltree
=========

Convert each region of an image into a tree. E.g. a tracing of a hand into connected branches between fingers and wrist.

This was motivated by [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20730166/building-tree-graph-from-image-points) on StackOverflow. I just couldn't let it go until I had something working.

It's more of a demo and not setup to work as in CLI or even as a library right now. It wouldn't take much work to get it there though.
